    // ToDo: Gurjeet -> write Bus Manager

    // The bus manager should include an array list to store Bus objects (see UserRegistration)

    // The bus manager has three functionalities (3 methods):
    // 1. List all busses
    // 2. Add busses (randomly assigned unique ID, route (route selection from route list), date, time, capacity)
    // 3. Remove busses by ID
}
